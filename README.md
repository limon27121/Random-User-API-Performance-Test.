## Overview

The Simple Grocery Store API provides product data via the endpoint `http://simple-grocery-store-api.online/products`. Performance testing was conducted to ensure the API can handle various levels of traffic and to identify its maximum capacity.

## Tests Conducted

### Load Test

Load testing was conducted to determine how the API performs under expected user loads. The test aimed to identify response times, throughput, and potential bottlenecks.

### Stress Test

Stress testing was performed to determine the API's behavior under extreme conditions. This test helps identify the point at which the API fails or experiences significant performance degradation.

### Capacity Analysis

Capacity analysis was conducted to establish the maximum number of requests the API can handle before its performance becomes unacceptable or it fails.
